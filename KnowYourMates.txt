Hi There!

We are very excited about kicking off this workshop. As a fun activity for getting comfortable with git and github - the medium we will use for sharing our code - lets add a bit about ourselves to this file. Then Add. Commit. Push! This will help all the participants and mentors to get to know each other. Try to include some fun, whacky facts about yourself :-)

Hello, I’m Parul Gupta - I will be one of your mentors for this workshop. My history traverses many wonderful places, including Jaipur, IIT Bombay and Southern California. I am also one of the founders of SlideRule, a self-taught pythonista and very passionate about the potential of open online learning. 

Fun trivia about me: My masters degree from UCLA has Arnold Schwarzenegger’s autograph on it. I will treat any quizzing geniuses here who can guess the connection ;-)

Over to the next person!

@Parul: Arnold Schwarzenegger was California's governer when you were doing an MS. ;-) You are using smart / curly quotes on your mac. Change them to ascii/straight quotes.

Hi, I'm Jitendra Agrawal (you can call me Jeet) - I will working with you throughout this workshop and I hope you will be as excited about writing code as I am by the end of this interaction. I have been fortunate enough to build some popular applications from scratch. A quick list - a search engine, webmail, online document storage (that's Google Drive or Dropbox for you), voice mail, missed call alerts, caller ringback tones (hello tunes) and a social network. I am part of the tech team at SlideRule and I enjoy writing Python.
